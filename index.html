      <h1>PACS dataviz</h1>
      <span class="subtitle">government organized contest to encourage french open data</span> 
    </div>
    <div class="content">
      <p class="description">The contest was once again very generic, you just had to create something based on a certain set of newly released data. Diving into huge datasets and making something out of it kind of attracted me, but I could not find any original idea .. the day before the end I told myself, it would really suck to miss on it, so I just went ahead and realized the only idea I had had : an interactive map of PACS sealings amongst french Regions along the years. And that was not as easy as I expected ! I pulled an all-nighter on that one and even missed the next day class to end right to the deadline. I guess it was worth it, since I won (together with 3 other projects, but still :). The prize was quite interesting since it was an invitation to assist LeWeb'11 and demonstrate our apps there.</p>

      <h1>Izikiz.com website</h1>
      <span class="subtitle">exchange students house-swapping</span> 
    </div>
    <div class="content">
      <p class="description">This idea originated from a friend's father : he figured why not adapt the house-swapping idea of websites like echangedemaison.com to exchange students ? It makes sense, since each year there are thousands of students going abroad for months, semesters or years with symetrical flows.. so wouldn't it be great if I could just swap my Paris flat with an Romanese student as I leave for a semester there and he comes for one ? With this idea we built wireframes, applied and won a few regional fundings, got a custom design and logo made by a graphic freelancers, and I started developing it. There were quite a few iterations on building this project, and it has yet to be finished and properly launched.</p>

      <h1>Android Musicsheet App</h1>
      <span class="subtitle">prototype for a mobile app contest</span> 
    </div>
    <div class="content">
      <p class="description">Alten organized a contest, called ID'Mobile, in which the only guideline was to build an app. A friend from my school, Yue Wang, applied for it with the following concept : create a proper Digital Musicsheet, that would manage your collection, flip pages as you played your instrument, point out the notes you misplayed ... That was quite an ambitious project but he got picked for the first selection, so together with Luo Cheng I joined him to form a 3-men team as required, and we started building it. We spent a lot of time on it, trying to figure out how to handle the FFT, time-windows, mic-sampling, chatting with some of our professors implicated in Music softwares.. We managed to have a prototype that could recognize a simple predefined tune's sheet, and flip the pages accordingly to a predefined record. We had also started work on generalizing it to real instrument playing, and to any music sheet, thanks to the lilypond format, but it was not finished on time.</p>

      <span class="subtitle">small blog with big audience turned into a noobie website</span> 
    </div>
    <div class="content">
      <p class="description">My cousin and me used to create blogs on the trending new things, just as a hobby to try and make it to the top of this platform : Skyblog. Somehow we managed to with this one : msntrucastuce, which as it's title indicates contained all sort of stuff for the late MSN Messenger (now WLM). That includes emoticons & sounds, plugins, rare characters pseudo generators ... all of which turned out to be pretty indispensable for teenagers at this period. When we reached the first position of this platform, we decided to go 'serious', and build a proper website. I was put in charge of this, not really because I was more able to, but rather because I was more into it. So that was my first real website, and I learnt almost everything from scratch while building it, hence the poor result. But hey, that's how I got in the game !</p>
