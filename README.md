# Why build this text-database-like script ?!


I wanted to completely separate my content and my presentation, but without a classic database, that seems
way overkill for such a simple, static pages website.

I couldn't find any decent solution on the web so I decided to just go for it and write a small script. And heck, it never hurts to write some python and regexes.
